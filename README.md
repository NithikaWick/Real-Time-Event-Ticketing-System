# Real-Time-Event-Ticketing-System
This is a Real-Time Event Ticketing System developed as my University project. It implements the Producer-Consumer pattern to handle concurrent ticket releases and purchases, ensuring data integrity and synchronization. The system features a user-friendly interface and robust backend to simulate a dynamic ticketing environment.
